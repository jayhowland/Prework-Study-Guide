# Prework study guide for Coding Bootcamp

## Description

This is a web based study guide, to give me general knowledge and ideas on what and how to use Github, write basic html5 code, css and javascript.

- My motivtion for this project weas to ensure that I had notes and to show my work thourgh the prework modules. To show that I understood wht i was learning and to have a general reference to go back to as I go through bootcamp and likelyihood to add mor einformation as I learn more. 
- I built this as an ongoing location for notes and to make more of my own personal cheat sheet for building and designing web sites.
- This solves a few issues for me as i have zero prior knowledge of coding and what i did know was way out dated. 
- I learned through the work-thru that what i knew previouly for HTML was way out dated and that currently the seperation of items of HTML and CSS makes life A LOT easier. And that the compact coding of Java, eases tCSS and Java this now makes debugging and formatting a lot easier than it was almost 30yrs ago.
