          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>a padding indicates how much space we want around the inside content of an element.</li>
          <li>* indicates a wild card symbol, that designates the changes will be applied to all elements on the page, and will set both the margins and padding properties with set values.</li>
          <li>DRY(do not repeat yourself) coding to help share peices of coding and reduce the number of lines of the codebase.</li>
          <li>text-align, will designate where youe text will be aligned per the setting of the page.</li>
          <li>link is used to link your based file to any associate outside source material.</li>
          <li>href is used to specify the location of those outside sources by using a relative path to connect the based code to the current location of assocaited files or sources.</li>
          <li>card is a classs selector designation.</li>
          <li>a period that proceeds a class selector designates it as a clas selctor, and any html element assigned this clas will hold all associated css properties.</li>
          <li>width selects the desired width of an elelment</li>
          <li>margin selects the desired height and width by designating two values</li>
          <li>border designates a desired style of border by assinging a specific size and color and opaqueness.</li>
          <li>box-shadow will add a shadow effect to the associated element and is described by a x and y offset values relative to the element(blur, spread radius and color(by a hexadecimal color code))</li>

        <h2>JAVAScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Declare a vaarible witht the (let) keyword</li>
          <li>A semicolon at the end of a line indicates where a statements ends, only req. is if multiple statements on single line.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is read top to bottom and the order in which the script is writtem is important.</li>
          <li>Use of conditional statments/loops to control the order in which code is executed or if its executed at all.</li>
          <li>When using the IF statement, code will only execute if the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>What exactly is “truthy” and “falsy” in Javascript? A value is considered falsy if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of false. All other values, including a Boolean with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, we can have more than one condition—by using else if</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>The array length is important because the for loop needs to know how many times the code will run until there are no items left in the array.</li>
          <li>You can find the length of an array by using a built-in property of an array, appropriately named length.></li>
          <li>FOR loop contains three important statments
                1st. determines the starting point, we declare this by using variable x = 0, because the 1st index of any array is ALWAYS 0
                2nd, sets the condition, if x < the length of the loop, the loop will continuously run. We use LENGTH built-in array property to express the condition - x < array.length;.
                3rd. is the final statement allows the array to iterate over each item. Indicies run in a predictable pattern of +1 for each loop, shortcut code is x++</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run. Instead, you must call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>To create a function, we use the function keyword, similar to how we used the var keyword to declare a new variable.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
